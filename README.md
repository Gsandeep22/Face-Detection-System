# Face Detection System  
**Professional Seminar Course - Rivier University**  

## 1. User Story  
As a system administrator, I want an AI-powered face detection system that can accurately identify and locate human faces within images, so that I can enhance security and automate user authentication efficiently.

## 2. Description  
The **Face Detection System** detects faces in static images for security and identity verification purposes. It employs **deep learning models** such as **Haar Cascades** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for accurate face localization and bounding box generation.  

### **Core Functionalities:**  
- Detects human faces in images.  
- Supports multiple image formats (**JPEG, PNG, BMP**).  
- Provides high accuracy and low false positives/negatives.  
- Ensures privacy compliance (**GDPR, CCPA**).  
- Generates visual bounding boxes for detected faces.  
- Logs detection results for auditing.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria  

### **Face Detection Accuracy**  
- The system should detect faces in various lighting conditions and positions with **≥95% accuracy**.  

### **Image Format Support**  
- Supports image formats: **JPEG, PNG, BMP**.  

### **Performance**  
- Face detection should complete **within 2 seconds** per image.  


### **Security and Privacy**  
- Image processing should ensure **identity anonymization** and compliance with **GDPR/CCPA**.  

### **Visualization**  
- Detected faces should be **boxed** in the processed image.  
 

### **Logging and Reporting**  
- Maintain records of:  
  - Number of detected faces.  
  - Processing time.
